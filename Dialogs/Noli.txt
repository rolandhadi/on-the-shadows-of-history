woman, symbolizing constancy
religious faith symbolized by the tomb stone, with a laurel (courage)
and the flower of pomelo, worn by bride and groom at a wedding symbolizing purity.

Al escribir e (sta obra he estado) pensando continuamente e (n vosotros que me) habeis infundido los p (rimeros pensamientos) ylas primeras ideas; a (vosotros as dedi) co este manuscrito de mi (joventud como p) rueba de amor. Berlin (de Febrero de) 1887.

At the bottom, all that is worst in Philippine life: the helmet of the Civil Guard, the whip and instruments of torture, and the foot of the friar.
