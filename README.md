	The game has full of adventures, challenges, and sub-quests to solve, it showcases three major quests and these are: Childhood years in Calamba, Rizal in Ateneo, and Last Hours at Fort Santiago. The story introduces the protagonist named Ross, a typical student who loves playing computer and video games and not paying too much attention to his studies. Until he met an accident and a mysterious woman with a hi-tech Chronopad – that will change his life for twenty-four hours.
	The game was created using Visual Basic 6.0 and Direct X version 7 for its programming purposes.
